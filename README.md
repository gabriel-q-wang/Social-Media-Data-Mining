# Social Media Data Mining

A simple example of social media data mining and sentiment analysis using Twitter APIs, Google Trends, and Machine Learning

## Running

All scripts are in python. Note you may require Twitter and Google accounts to use their APIs. Dependancies can be installed as follows.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the various scripts depending on the service. Scripts will collect data from the APIs, train models such as tokenizers and decision trees to determine sentiment of text, then run comparisons between various users or other queries. This may be helpful for companies determining their social media impact in comparison to their competitors.
